# Troubleshooting with Cursor AI

## General

Help identify and resolve a technical issue in my project by first thoroughly reviewing the @Codebase for relevant sections. Begin by analyzing recent changes and any system warnings or errors associated with the issue. Use @Web resources and current documentation to gather additional context or insights where needed. Based on the findings, break down the probable causes of the problem and outline a structured plan for resolving each potential cause. After implementing solutions, confirm their effectiveness through testing. If issues persist, generate a detailed log and system summary for further investigation and suggest advanced troubleshooting steps if needed.
